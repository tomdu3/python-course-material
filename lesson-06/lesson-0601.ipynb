    "\n",
    "Object oriented programming is a programming paradigm that uses objects and their interactions to design applications. It is an ultimate approach to software development and reusability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Object Oriented Programming is a fundamental concept in Python, empowering developers to build modular, maintainable, and scalable applications. By understanding the core OOP principles—classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction—programmers can leverage the full potential of Python’s OOP capabilities to design elegant and efficient solutions to complex problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.1.2. What is Object-Oriented Programming in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python object-oriented Programming (OOPs) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes in programming. It aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphisms, encapsulation, etc. in the programming. The main concept of object-oriented Programming (OOPs) or oops concepts in Python is to bind the data and the functions that work together as a single unit so that no other part of the code can access this data. \n",
    "\n",
    "We use objects and classes in Python to define the real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphisms, encapsulation, etc."

    "\n",
    "A class is a collection of objects. A class contains the blueprints or the prototype from which the objects are being created. It is a logical entity that contains some attributes and methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the need for creating a class let’s consider an example, let’s say you wanted to track the number of dogs that may have different attributes like breed, and age. If a list is used, the first element could be the dog’s breed while the second element could represent its age. Let’s suppose there are 100 different dogs, then how would you know which element is supposed to be which? What if you wanted to add other properties to these dogs? This lacks organization and it’s the exact need for classes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some points on Python class:  \n",
    "\n",
    "    Classes are created by keyword class.\n",
