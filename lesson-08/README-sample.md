## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

To get started with the project, clone the repository to a local machine using the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/my-python-project.git
```
Replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username.

### Install Dependencies

Once you've cloned the repository, navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies using the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This will install all the dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

### Create a .env File

To create a `.env` file, run the following command:
```
touch .env
```
This will create a new file called `.env` in the project directory.

### Define Environmental Variables

In the `.env` file, define environmental variables using the following syntax:
```
VARIABLE_NAME=value
```
For example:
```
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=myuser
DB_PASSWORD=mypassword
```
This will define three environmental variables: `DB_HOST`, `DB_USER`, and `DB_PASSWORD`.

### Running the Project

To run the project, use the following command:
```
python my_project.py
```
You can then use the defined environmental variables in your code by accessing them using the `os.environ` dictionary.


**Step 1: Start**

* Start by running the project using `python my_project.py`.

**Step 2: Input Data**

* Enter your input data using the command-line interface.

**Step 3: Process Data**

* The project will process your input data using the algorithms and logic implemented in the code.

**Step 4: Output Results**

* The project will output the results of the processing step to the console.

**Step 5: End**

* The project will terminate and return to the command line.
