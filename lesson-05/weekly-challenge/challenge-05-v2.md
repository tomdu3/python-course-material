# Python Programming Projects with Guidance

## Project 1: Movie Collection Organizer

### Objective
Create a program that helps users organize their movie collection using tuples, sets, and dictionaries.

### Requirements
- Store movie details (title, year, genre) using tuples.
- Use sets to manage unique genres and prevent duplicate entries.
- Use dictionaries to store movie details with the movie title as the key.

### Features
- Add new movies to the collection.
- Remove movies from the collection.
- List all movies by genre.
- Search for a movie by title.

### Guidance
- **Start Small:** Begin with a simple dictionary to store movies and their details. Expand functionality step-by-step.
- **Data Integrity:** Ensure that the movie title is unique by using it as the dictionary key.
- **User Input:** Implement a simple menu system for user interactions.
- **Edge Cases:** Consider what happens if a user tries to add a duplicate movie or search for a movie that doesn't exist.

### Concepts Covered
- Tuples
- Sets
- Dictionaries
- Data manipulation and access

## Project 2: Student Grades Management System

### Objective
Develop a system to manage and analyze student grades using complex data structures.

### Requirements
- Store student information (name, ID) and their grades using dictionaries.
- Use tuples to store grade details (subject, score).
- Utilize sets to track unique subjects.

### Features
- Add new students and their grades.
- Update existing grades.
- Calculate the average grade for each student.
- List all students and their grades.

### Guidance
- **Data Structure:** Use a nested dictionary to store student information and grades.
- **Calculations:** Write functions to calculate averages and handle grade updates.
- **Validation:** Ensure grades are valid numbers and handle invalid input gracefully.
- **User Interface:** Create a command-line interface for user interactions.

### Concepts Covered
- Dictionaries
- Tuples
- Sets
- Data manipulation and calculations

## Project 3: Library Book Tracker

### Objective
Create a program to track library books, their availability, and manage borrowers using dictionaries and sets.

### Requirements
- Store book details (title, author, year) using dictionaries.
- Use sets to keep track of available and borrowed books.
- Implement a borrowing system to manage book loans.

### Features
- Add new books to the library.
- Mark books as borrowed or returned.
- List all available and borrowed books.
- Search for a book by title or author.

### Guidance
- **State Management:** Use sets to track the state of books (available or borrowed).
- **Dictionary Keys:** Use unique identifiers like ISBN as dictionary keys.
- **Functions:** Write functions to handle borrowing and returning books.
- **Feedback:** Provide clear feedback to users when they borrow or return books.

### Concepts Covered

- Sets
- Data manipulation and access

## Project 4: Contact Book Application

### Objective
Develop a contact book application to store and manage contact information using dictionaries and tuples.

### Requirements
- Store contact details (name, phone number, email) using dictionaries.
- Use tuples to store immutable contact information (date of birth, address).
- Implement search and update functionalities.

### Features
- Add new contacts.
- Update existing contacts.
- Search for contacts by name.
- List all contacts.

### Guidance
- **Data Structure:** Use dictionaries for mutable data and tuples for immutable data.
- **Search Functionality:** Implement search by name with partial matches.
- **Error Handling:** Manage errors gracefully, such as updating a non-existent contact.
- **User Experience:** Design an intuitive user interface for adding, updating, and searching contacts.

### Concepts Covered
