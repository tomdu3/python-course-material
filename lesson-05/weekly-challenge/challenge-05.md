# Personal Library Management System:
- Description: Create a Python application to manage a personal library of books. This project involves creating user-defined modules to handle different functionalities such as adding new books, listing all books, searching for a book by title or author, and deleting a book.
- Modules and Files Used: Use built-in modules like os for file management and file I/O operations to save the book data to a text file. User-defined modules can be created for different operations like book management and file handling.

# Weather Data Collector:
- Description: Develop a script that collects weather data from an API and saves it to a file. The program should fetch data periodically and append it to a CSV file.
- Modules and Files Used: Use third-party modules like requests to fetch data from the API and pandas for managing CSV files. File I/O operations will handle reading from and writing to CSV files.

# Automated Log File Analyzer:
- Description: Build a tool to analyze log files from a web server. The tool should parse log files, extract useful information (like error rates, most visited pages), and generate a summary report.
-Modules and Files Used: Use built-in modules like os for file operations and datetime for handling timestamps. File I/O operations will be crucial for reading and processing log files.

# Simple Budget Tracker:
- Description: Create a budget tracker that allows users to input their expenses and income, and then generates a report of their financial status. The program should allow for adding, removing, and listing expenses and incomes.
- Modules and Files Used: Use built-in modules like os and datetime, and user-defined modules for handling different functionalities. Use file I/O operations to store and retrieve the financial data.

# Movie Database:
- Description: Develop a program to manage a database of movies. Users can add new movies, list all movies, search for movies by different criteria, and remove movies from the database.
- Modules and Files Used: Use built-in modules like os for file handling and file I/O operations to read and write data to a text file. User-defined modules can be created for handling movie data operations.
