    "# Lesson 4: Working with Files in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to permanently store data, we need to work with files. Files can be of different kind, from a simple text to a complex object like a database, video, audio, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4.1. Files I/O in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "We will first introduce the general approach to a file I/O in Python. The simplest one is to read and write to a file. We will see how to read and write to a text file.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4.1.1. Reading from a File\n",
    "\n",
    "- To read a file we use the `open` function.\n",
    "- `open` takes two arguments: the name of the file and a mode.\n",
    "  - syntax: `open(filename, mode)`\n",
    "  - `filename` is the name of the file\n",
    "  - `mode` is a string that specifies how the file will be read. The default value is `r` for reading. You can also use `w` for writing. `a` for appending. If we ommit the mode, it will be `r` by default.\n",
    "- it is important to know that the file exists and that we can access it. Otherwise, we will get an error.\n",
    "- after we have opened the file, we need to read it. We can do that with different methods:\n",
    "  - `read` method reads the whole file as a string.\n",
    "  - `readline` method reads a line. \n",
    "  - `readlines` method reads all the lines and returns them as a list.\n",
    "  - `next` method skips to the next line. It returns the next line and advances the cursor. It is useful when we want to read a file line by line.\n",
    "- `close` method closes the file. It is very important to always close the file. Otherwise, the file will not be accessible."
