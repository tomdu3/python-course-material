    - Introducing the basic concepts of OOP (classes, objects, methods).
    - Live coding demonstration: Creating a simple class to represent a student, including attributes and methods.
- **Challenge**: Modify the week 2 quiz program to use object-oriented programming principles (e.g., create a class to represent a question and another class for the quiz).
  
Day 6 (2.5 hours)
- **Topic**: Modules and Packages (1 hour) 
    - Importing and using modules and packages to extend functionality.
    - Live coding demonstration: Importing and using the math module for various mathematical functions.
- **Topic**: Web Scraping Basics (1 hour)    
    - Introduction to web scraping techniques and ethical considerations.  
    - Live coding demonstration: Using a library like BeautifulSoup to extract simple data from a webpage. Example:   
        - Access a publicly available website (like a weather forecast page). 
        - Use requests to fetch the HTML content of the page.
        - Use BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML and extract specific elements containing desired data (e.g., current temperature).
        - Display the extracted data to the user.
- **Challenge**: Build a simple web scraper that retrieves product information (e.g., name, price) from a product listing page on an online store (choose a website with ethical scraping practices).
  
Day 7 (2.5 hours)
- **Topic**: Automation (1 hour)
    - Automating repetitive tasks on the computer using Python.
    - Live coding demonstration: Automating tasks like file renaming, folder organization, or data extraction from simple text files.
